 # When Eclipse is ran it seems to create additional icon in Windows taskbar if it is already pinned there. To have only pinned icon in taskbar when Eclipse is running:
   # Unpin eclipse from taskbar.
   # Add following at the top of eclipse.ini (next to eclipse.exe):
     {{{
     -vm
     C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin
     }}}
   # Run Eclipse.
   # Pin created icon to taskbar.
